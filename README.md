# OVERFLOW
Microsoft Flow Attack Framework

Derbycon Drop of My Flow Talk 'Attacking with Automation'

You will need to create your own 'request' flows and load them into the script.

Update RequestFlow="" and Downloadbypass=""

I will need to upload those flows into your Microsoft Tenent.
I might just release a document to walk you through making your own flow.
Follow @surbo for updates.



Requirements:
