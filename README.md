# OVERFLOW
Microsoft Flow Attack Framework

Derbycon Drop of My Flow Talk 'Attacking with Automation'

You will need to create your own 'request' flows and load them into the script.

Update RequestFlow="" and Downloadbypass=""

I will need to upload those flows into your Microsoft Tenant.
I might just release a document to walk you through making your own flow.
Follow @surbo for updates.


Q: Is it overflow or ovRflow?
A: It's OvRflow!

Q: Why did you make the repo overflow then?
A: Because people would spell it correctly

Q: Then why not spell it correctly then?
A: It would be hard to find because of Buffer Overflow. Also @archwisp said not to name it overflow =)
